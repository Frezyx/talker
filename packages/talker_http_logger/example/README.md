# Example Project

This example demonstrates the usage of the talker_http_logger package for logging HTTP requests, responses, and
errors.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```shell
flutter pub get
```

## Running the Example

To run the example application:

```shell
flutter run
```

## Directory Structure

Within the example directory you will typically find:

- A main entry point that demonstrates the logging functionality.
- Supporting files or configurations that illustrate how logging is customized using the package's settings.

## Customization

- Adjust logging settings directly within the example code to explore options such as:
    - Printing request headers and data.
    - Displaying cURL commands to replicate HTTP requests.
    - Customizing the output format of errors, responses, and request logs.
